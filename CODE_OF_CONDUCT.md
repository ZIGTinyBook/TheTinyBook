# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Good practices
- Marco queste le lascio fare a te se sei pi√π sul pezzo, aggiungo giusto quelle che mi vengono in mente
- all tests pass without any modification (zig build test_all --summary all)
- anytime you add a class or a function it must be well tested 
- If not well documented the code will be rejected
- The code must be well written, not ambiguous and not redundant
- Qualcosa riguardo le "Open a Issue"
- Qualcosa riguardo le "Pull request"
- Qualcosa riguardo le "git push"

## Our Responsibilities

behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
